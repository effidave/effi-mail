5. Development Approach and Work Packages

Work Package Agreement Process
The parties shall work together to agree each Work Package before the Supplier commences work. Each Work Package shall be documented in writing and signed by both parties' Contract Managers.
Each Work Package shall specify:
scope of work, including technical objectives and deliverables;
timeline and key milestones;
resources required, including personnel, equipment and materials;
estimated budget and any budget caps;
acceptance criteria and review process; and
any Norton Technology to be provided to the Supplier.
Norton may propose a Work Package by providing the Supplier with a written description of the proposed scope, objectives and timeline. The Supplier shall, within 10 Business Days, provide Norton with a detailed proposal including resource requirements, estimated costs and proposed timeline.
The parties shall negotiate in good faith to agree the final terms of each Work Package. No Work Package shall be binding until signed by both parties' Contract Managers.
Work Package Change Control
Either party may propose changes to an agreed Work Package by submitting a written change request to the other party's Contract Manager, setting out:
the nature and reason for the proposed change;
the impact on scope, timeline and deliverables; and
the estimated impact on costs and resources.
The receiving party shall respond to a change request within 10 Business Days, either accepting the change, proposing modifications, or rejecting it with reasons.
No change to a Work Package shall be effective until agreed in writing and signed by both parties' Contract Managers. The Supplier shall not implement any change until it has been formally agreed.
Review and Planning Meetings
The parties shall hold regular Work Package review meetings at intervals agreed in each Work Package (and in any event not less frequently than monthly) to:
review progress against milestones and objectives;
discuss technical findings, challenges and solutions;
review budget and resource utilisation;
identify and manage risks and issues;
plan activities for the next period; and
discuss opportunities for improvement.
Each review meeting shall be attended by each party's Contract Manager and relevant technical personnel. The Supplier shall prepare and circulate meeting agendas at least 3 Business Days in advance.
The Supplier shall prepare written minutes of each review meeting documenting decisions made, actions agreed and issues identified. Minutes shall be circulated to both parties within 5 Business Days of each meeting.
At the completion of each Work Package, the parties shall hold a retrospective meeting to review what worked well, what could be improved and lessons learned for future Work Packages.
Written Reports
The Supplier shall provide Norton with written progress reports for each active Work Package at the frequency specified in that Work Package (and in any event not less frequently than monthly).
Each progress report shall include:
summary of work completed during the reporting period;
progress against milestones and deliverables;
key technical findings and outcomes;
actual costs incurred and comparison to budget;
forecast of costs to completion;
identification of risks, issues and dependencies;
planned activities for the next reporting period; and
any matters requiring Norton decision or input.
The Supplier shall immediately notify Norton in writing of any circumstances that may materially affect the delivery of a Work Package, including any anticipated delay, cost overrun, or technical obstacle.
Upon completion of each Work Package, the Supplier shall prepare a Completion Report documenting the work performed, results achieved, deliverables provided and any recommendations for future work.
Acceptance Criteria and Process
The parties shall work together to agree specific acceptance criteria for each Work Package before work commences. The acceptance criteria shall be documented in the Work Package agreement.
Acceptance criteria shall be appropriate to the nature of the work and may include:
technical performance specifications and tolerances;
testing and validation requirements;
documentation and reporting standards;
quality standards and inspection procedures;
completion of specific deliverables; and
achievement of Project Objectives.
When the Supplier believes a Work Package (or milestone within a Work Package) meets the acceptance criteria, it shall notify Norton in writing and provide evidence of compliance with the acceptance criteria.
Norton shall, within the period specified in the Work Package agreement, review the work and either accept it, accept it subject to minor remedial work, or reject it with detailed reasons.
If work is rejected, the parties shall work together in good faith to agree what remedial work is required. The Supplier shall carry out agreed remedial work at no additional cost to Norton unless the rejection resulted from a change in requirements not previously communicated to the Supplier.
Given the nature of research and development work, the parties acknowledge that outcomes may vary from initial expectations. Where work has been performed in accordance with agreed methodologies and standards but does not achieve the desired technical outcome, this shall not constitute a failure to meet acceptance criteria, provided the Supplier has used reasonable skill and care.
Work Package Disputes
If a dispute arises in relation to any Work Package (including disputes about scope, acceptance, technical approach, or costs), either party may refer the matter to the other party's Contract Manager for resolution.
The Contract Managers shall meet (in person or remotely) within 5 Business Days of the dispute being raised and shall use reasonable endeavours to resolve the dispute through good faith negotiation.
If the Contract Managers cannot resolve the dispute within 10 Business Days, either party may escalate the matter to senior management in accordance with clause 34 of this agreement.
Where a dispute relates to technical matters, the parties may agree to appoint an independent technical expert to provide a non-binding opinion on the matter in dispute. The costs of any such expert shall be shared equally unless the parties agree otherwise.
Unless otherwise agreed or directed by Norton, the Supplier shall continue to perform the Services during any dispute resolution process, provided Norton continues to pay undisputed amounts in accordance with this agreement.
Nothing in this Schedule limits the parties' rights under the dispute resolution provisions in clause 34 or any other provision of this agreement.
Roles and Responsibilities
Contract Manager Responsibilities
16. Each party's Contract Manager shall have the following responsibilities in relation to Work Packages:

day-to-day oversight and coordination of Work Package delivery;
negotiating and agreeing Work Package terms and changes;
monitoring progress, budget and risks;
facilitating communication between the parties;
resolving operational issues and escalating matters as appropriate;
reviewing and approving progress reports; and
ensuring compliance with this agreement and Work Package terms.
Technical Lead Responsibilities
17. Each party may designate a Technical Lead for each Work Package. The Technical Leads shall:

provide technical direction and guidance for the Work Package;
work together to resolve technical challenges and issues;
review technical deliverables and provide feedback;
assess technical risks and recommend mitigation strategies;
ensure technical quality and compliance with standards;
facilitate knowledge transfer between the parties' technical teams; and
advise the Contract Managers on technical matters.
Decision-Making Authority
18. The following decision-making authority levels apply:

Technical Leads may approve: (a) technical approaches and methodologies within agreed scope; (b) technical specifications and standards; (c) deliverable formats and documentation standards; and (d) technical risk mitigation strategies.
Contract Managers may approve: (a) written agreement of new Work Packages; (b) routine operational decisions within agreed Work Package scope; (c) schedule adjustments; (d) Work Package changes; (e) resource allocation decisions.
Contract Managers do not have authority to grant a licence of Intellectual Property Rights or approve the use of Confidential Information outside of the scope of a Work Package.
Any decision outside these authority levels must be escalated to the appropriate level for approval before implementation.
Knowledge Sharing and Transfer
For each Work Package, the Supplier shall deliver technical documentation appropriate to the nature and stage of the work, including design documentation, test results, materials specifications and recommendations for further development.
The Supplier shall provide knowledge transfer sessions as reasonably requested by Norton, including:
technical briefings on work performed and results achieved;
training on methodologies, tools and processes developed;
demonstrations of prototypes and deliverables;
workshops on technical capabilities developed; and
handover sessions for completed Work Packages.
Norton shall have the right to observe work in progress and access the Supplier's facilities (subject to reasonable notice and security requirements) to facilitate knowledge transfer and understanding of the Services.
The parties shall share relevant technical information and expertise openly to facilitate effective problem-solving and achievement of Project Objectives.
Joint Problem-Solving
When technical challenges or obstacles arise, the parties shall work together in good faith to identify and implement solutions.
The Supplier shall promptly notify Norton of any technical issues that may impact the delivery of a Work Package. The parties' Technical Leads shall meet promptly to assess the issue and agree on a resolution approach.
Each party shall make available appropriate technical resources and expertise to support problem-solving activities as reasonably required.
Where a technical issue requires a change to Work Package scope, timeline, or budget, the change control process set out in this Schedule shall apply.
Prototype Development and Testing
Testing of prototypes and development outputs shall be conducted through iterative review cycles rather than rigid pass/fail acceptance gates. The parties shall agree the testing approach for each Work Package, which may include bench testing, simulated environment testing, field testing and performance validation.
Test results shall be documented and reviewed jointly. Where testing reveals issues or opportunities for improvement, the parties shall agree whether to proceed with refinement, pursue alternative approaches, or conclude that aspect of the work.
