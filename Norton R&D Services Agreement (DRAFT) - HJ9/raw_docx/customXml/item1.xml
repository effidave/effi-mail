Commercial organisations with a global turnover of £36 million or more must publish an annual slavery and human trafficking statement (<link href="7-608-3825" style="ACTLinkPLCtoPLC"><ital>section 54</ital></link>). The statement must disclose what steps the organisation has taken to ensure that human trafficking is not taking place in any of its supply chains or its business, or state that it has taken no steps. A customer may therefore want to include wording in its services agreements to prohibit the use of forced or trafficked labour by suppliers and require adherence to its anti-slavery policies.

The customer should assess if a generic clause is sufficient or whether it also wants to include additional duties to comply with specific laws that represent a high risk to the customer. For instance, if the supplier operates in a sector or country that is deemed high risk for bribery and corruption, the customer may want to include a bespoke anti-bribery clause to address this. Optional wording in <internal.reference refid="a970716"><ital>clause 12</ital></internal.reference> requires the supplier to adhere to specific obligations in relation to bribery, fraud and modern slavery.</paratext>

Normally the party providing the third party-owned material will be responsible for procuring a licence to enable the other party to use it as necessary.

                    <paratext>An indemnity for infringement of IPRs is sometimes accompanied by a right or an obligation for the indemnifying party to try to avoid the claim by procuring a licence to use the infringing item or modifying it so that it ceases to infringe. If the indemnifying party fails to do so, the indemnified party can terminate the agreement and receive a refund of charges in relation to the infringing items.

The property damage cap is drafted on a per event basis. Additional wording clarifies what is meant by property. As a pro-customer agreement, this is drafted broadly to include items such as equipment and other assets, as well as premises. If the risk of property damage is minimal, the customer may choose not to include a separate cap for property damage.</paratext>

Having a separate cap for this avoids the risk of data protection liabilities exhausting all or most of a general cap, so that there is none left for other liabilities that are subsequently incurred. The drafting provides options for an overall cap or a cap per breach or indemnity claim.</paratext>

Instead ensure that the services schedule reflects the customer's requirements and commits the supplier to any particular outcome which is important to the customer (for example, the achievement of a particular goal or a particular level of savings). Where there is both a customer's requirements document and a supplier's standard description of the services, avoid relying on both and specifying that one will take precedence. Any conflicts should be identified and the correct position stated in a single document.</paratext>

The wording should create clearly enforceable obligations so make clear who is doing each obligation, when they must do it and what needs to be done.</paratext>

                  <paratext>As mentioned in <internal.reference refid="a269079"><ital>Drafting note, Transfer of employees under TUPE</ital></internal.reference>, TUPE can apply where there is a "service provision change".

                      <paratext><bold>TUPE on entry.</bold> At the start of the services, if TUPE applies, then employees of the customer or a former supplier who have been allocated to providing substantially equivalent services transfer from the customer or former supplier to the supplier. As the supplier will be taking on these individuals, it may want contractual protection (in the form of warranties and indemnities) to cover any losses arising from those transfers. In a pro-customer agreement, the customer may choose to include no TUPE on entry provisions and leave it to the supplier to request them. However, the customer should bear in mind that the supplier is likely to ask for TUPE on entry protections where the supplier is being asked to provide TUPE on exit protections. Providing some TUPE on entry provisions may help the customer to obtain the TUPE on exit provisions that it wants and minimise negotiations.</paratext>

The customer will want to seek appropriate TUPE warranties and indemnities for its own benefit and the benefit of any replacement supplier. A replacement supplier may look to the customer to secure protection for it against any liabilities it inherits under TUPE.</paratext>

This option includes customer-friendly drafting so that the supplier has to redeploy staff to avoid TUPE applying on exit. If any supplier personnel claim to have transferred to the customer or a replacement supplier on exit, the customer (or replacement supplier) can terminate their employment and the supplier indemnifies them against any resulting liabilities. The customer effectively transfers the risk of TUPE applying onto the supplier.</paratext>
