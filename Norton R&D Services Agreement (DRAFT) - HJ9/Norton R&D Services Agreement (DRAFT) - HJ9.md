   **3.** Review and Planning Meetings

      **3.1** The parties shall hold regular Work Package review meetings at intervals agreed in each Work Package (and in any event not less frequently than monthly) to:

      **5.4** Norton shall, within the period specified in the Work Package agreement, review the work and either accept it, accept it subject to minor remedial work, or reject it with detailed reasons.

      **5.5** If work is rejected, the parties shall work together in good faith to agree what remedial work is required. The Supplier shall carry out agreed remedial work at no additional cost to Norton unless the rejection resulted from a change in requirements not previously communicated to the Supplier.

      **5.6** Given the nature of research and development work, the parties acknowledge that outcomes may vary from initial expectations.
